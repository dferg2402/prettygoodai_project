# prettygoodai_project
Build a voice bot that calls our test line and has conversations with our AI agent. Your bot will act as a "patient" testing our system—finding bugs, evaluating quality, and stress-testing edge cases. This challenge tests what we actually care about: can you build something that works, reason through ambiguous problems, and ship?
